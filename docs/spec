## Tokens:

- RIGHT_BRACE,
- LEFT_PAREN,
- RIGHT_PAREN,
- WHITE_SPACE,
- TAG_TYPES,
- TAG_GEN,

*NO_TYPE, WHITE_SPACE need to be removed. They don't make sense.

*TAG_TYPES needs to be renamed to TAG_TABLE to avoid confusion

  

There are two Tags currently, @gen and @types. @types is a list of types and @gen tells the parser to generate code based on data from @types and other statements.

  

## Grammar

program  : table | gen

table : "@table" IDENTIFIER "{" types* "}" ";"

types    : "$" IDENTIFIER ":" IDENTIFIER "," IDENTIFIER * ";"
